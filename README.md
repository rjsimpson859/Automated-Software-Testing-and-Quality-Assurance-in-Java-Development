# CS320-Java-Software-Testing-Automation-and-Quality-Assurance
Applied software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development life cycle, including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. The creation of unit tests and analysis of various testing approaches will also be covered.

- **How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
  - I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by performing unit test and is executed as expected. Writing test code that included a high test coverage is essential for this. 
- **How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
  - I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by analyzing what their needs are and turning them into requirements for the program. These requirements are documented in great detail to allow for a high-level of expectations. 
- **How do I approach designing software?**
  -  After getting all the requirements, I then move forward with designing the software. I find it better to use visual methods such as UML Diagrams. This allows for everyone involved in the design process to see how the system will be designed and to ensure no requirements are missed.
